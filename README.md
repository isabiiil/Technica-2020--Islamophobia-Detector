# Technica-2020--Islamophobia-Detector
There is widespread misinformation and hate on Muslims, especially virtually. Online Islamophobia must be given the same attention as street-level Islamophobia. How can Muslims protect themselves from this hate?

We created a demo extension so that Muslims (or anyone)  can immediately become aware of the websites they are going to, as the extension alerts them of possible harmful language on the website, such as “anti-Islam.” This extension gives them a warning on whether they want to continue on possibly reading the harmful information themselves. In the future, we also hope to create a database of websites/shops that promote Islamophobia in some way besides the direct harmful language as input.
